# Architecture

Version: `0.8.1`

## Components

```text
apps/desktop-qt
  C++ / Qt 6 / QML desktop shell

crates/core
  Rust models, parser, local subscription structures

crates/ipc
  Versioned Rust command, event, request, and response schema

crates/service
  Rust service skeleton, named-pipe IPC endpoint, future privileged operations owner
```

## Direction

The desktop process is responsible for interaction, presentation, tray behavior, and simple local state. It must not own privileged networking or firewall policy in the final product.

The Rust service will own:

- engine lifecycle;
- TUN/system proxy operations;
- firewall and WFP rules;
- DNS leak protection;
- watchdog and recovery;
- audit logging;
- update and manifest verification hooks.

## Daily Flow

```text
Ctrl+V / Add subscription
  -> parse and save subscription
  -> render compact server list
  -> select server
  -> connect via service
  -> show speed, traffic, session time
```

The `0.8.1` build implements the shell, state model, versioned IPC envelopes, a Windows named-pipe service endpoint, real subscription ingestion, DPAPI-protected service storage, compact service-backed subscription groups, service-owned latency probes, Engine Manager V1, the first proxy path, the whole-computer TUN path foundation, the WireGuard/AmneziaWG adapter path, the app-routing policy foundation, and the first protection layer. The service now owns kill switch/DNS/IPv6/watchdog policy state, scoped firewall command planning, rollback on stop or unrecovered crash, and an emergency restore IPC command. Firewall enforcement is deliberately gated for privileged service runs until the installer/service identity and WFP layer are complete.
