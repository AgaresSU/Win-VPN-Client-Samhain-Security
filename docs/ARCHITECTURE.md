# Architecture

Version: `0.7.2`

## Components

```text
apps/desktop-qt
  C++ / Qt 6 / QML desktop shell

crates/core
  Rust models, parser, local subscription structures

crates/ipc
  Versioned Rust command, event, request, and response schema

crates/service
  Rust service skeleton, named-pipe IPC endpoint, future privileged operations owner
```

## Direction

The desktop process is responsible for interaction, presentation, tray behavior, and simple local state. It must not own privileged networking or firewall policy in the final product.

The Rust service will own:

- engine lifecycle;
- TUN/system proxy operations;
- firewall and WFP rules;
- DNS leak protection;
- watchdog and recovery;
- audit logging;
- update and manifest verification hooks.

## Daily Flow

```text
Ctrl+V / Add subscription
  -> parse and save subscription
  -> render compact server list
  -> select server
  -> connect via service
  -> show speed, traffic, session time
```

The `0.7.2` build implements the shell, state model, mock connection, versioned IPC envelopes, and a Windows named-pipe service endpoint. Real engine operations begin after service-owned state and subscription ingestion are hardened.
